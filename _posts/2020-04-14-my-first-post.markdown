Hello everyone. Welcome to my first public post ever.

I have thought about writing something for a long time. Finally, I decided to build this Github page, where I will have a space to write and share some of my random thoughts and technical tricks I learned over time. 

Starting from now, I will try my best to maintain this site and update it regularly. I am not very sure what I plan to write. But it is ok, I will find something, eventually.
